Electronics for my Capacitive Coin Counter.

In addition to these, you'll also need an OLED Screen, a Coin Accepter from Adafruit (adafruit coin acceptor), PowerBoost 500 or 1000 (https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-89078/l/power-boost-1000-charger-board) from Adafruit, and a MSP430FR2633 (https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-81128/l/capacitive-touch-evaluation-and-rapid-prototyping-for-msp430fr2633-microcontroller-mcu-development-kit) or MSP430 board from a CAPTIVATE Design Kit.

Oh and an Arduino. I used the Pyramiduino (https://www.hackster.io/baldengineer/pyramiduino-6d42c7), a board I designed to teach PCB design.
