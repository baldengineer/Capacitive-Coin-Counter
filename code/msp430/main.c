// Development main.c for MSP430FR2633, MSP430FR2533, MSP430FR2632, and
// MSP430FR2532.
//
// This starter application initializes the CapTIvate touch library
// for the touch panel specified by CAPT_UserConfig.c/.h via a call to
// CAPT_appStart(), which initializes and calibrates all sensors in the
// application, and starts the CapTIvate interval timer.
//
// Then, the capacitive touch interface is driven by calling the CapTIvate
// application handler, CAPT_appHandler().  The application handler manages
// whether the user interface (UI) is running in full active scan mode, or
// in a low-power wake-on-proximity mode.
//
// The CapTIvate application handler will return true if proximity was
// detected on any of the sensors in the application, which is used here
// to control the state of LED2. LED1 is set while the background loop enters
// the handler, and is cleared when the background loop leaves the handler.
//
// \version 1.60.00.03
// Released on November 22, 2017
